                <center><b><u><h1>STRUCTURE OF BLOOD</h1></u></b></center>
                <P>The structure of blood is complex, consisting of various cellular components suspended in a liquid matrix called plasma. Here's a detailed breakdown of the structure of blood:</P>
                <img src="structure.jpg" class="rightimage" width="400px" height="300px" border="5"></img> 
                <H3>1. Plasma</H3>
                <UL><LI><P>Composition: Plasma is the liquid component of blood, making up about 55% of its volume. It is primarily composed of water (about 90-92%), but also contains proteins, electrolytes, nutrients, hormones, and waste products.</P></LI>
                    <LI><P>Functions:</P></LI>
                    <LI><P>Transport: Plasma carries nutrients, hormones, and proteins to the parts of the body that need it.</P></LI> 
                    <LI><P> Waste Removal: It helps in the removal of waste products by transporting them to the kidneys, liver, and lungs for excretion.</P></LI>
                    <LI><P>Clotting: Plasma contains clotting factors that are essential for blood coagulation.</P></LI></UL>
                <H3>2. Formed Elements</H3>
                  <P>The remaining 45% of blood consists of the formed elements, which include red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.</P>
                  
                 <H3>A. Red Blood Cells (RBCs)</H3>

                    <LI><P> Lack of Nucleus: Mature RBCs do not have a nucleus, which allows more space for hemoglobin.</P></LI>
                        <LI><P> Hemoglobin: RBCs contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds oxygen and carbon dioxide for transport.</P></LI></OL>

                        <OL><LI><P> Oxygen Transport: RBCs carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.</P></LI>
                            <LI><P> Carbon Dioxide Transport: They transport carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs for exhalation.</P></LI></OL>
<H3>B. White Blood Cells (WBCs)</H3>
<img src="white.jpg" class="rightimage" width="400px" height="300px" border="5"></img>

<ul><li><p>Also Known As: Thrombocytes
<li><p>Structure:</p></li>
<li><p>Fragments: Platelets are small, cell fragments derived from larger cells called megakaryocytes in the bone marrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Function:</p></li>

<center><b><u><h1>Blood Groups</h1></u></b></center>
<p>Blood groups refer to classifications of blood based on the presence or absence of certain antigens on the surface of red blood cells and antibodies in the plasma. The two main systems used for blood grouping are the ABO system and the Rh factor system.</p>
<img src="groups.jpg" class="rightimage" width="400px" height="300px" border="5"></img> 
<h3>1.ABO Blood Group System:</h3>

<ul><li><p>Determines blood type based on the presence of A and B antigens on red blood cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Types: A, B, AB (both A and B antigens), and O (neither A nor B antigens).</p></li>
<li><p>Determines compatibility for blood transfusions.</p></li></ul>
<h3>2.Rh Factor System:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Determines the presence (+) or absence (-) of the Rh antigen (D antigen) on red blood cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Types: Rh-positive (+) and Rh-negative (-).</p></li>
<li><p>Important in pregnancy (Rh incompatibility can affect pregnancies).</p></li></ul>
<h3>3.Other Blood Group Systems:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Include additional antigens like Kell, Duffy, Kidd, and others.</p></li>
    <li><p>Less commonly used but important for specific medical conditions and transfusion needs.</p></li></ul>
<h3>4.Importance:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Crucial for safe blood transfusions and organ transplants.</p></li>
    <li><p>Determines compatibility between donors and recipients to prevent adverse reactions.</p></li></ul>
     <h3> 5.Rare Blood Types:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Such as Bombay blood group (lacks A, B, and H antigens) and Rh-null (lacks all Rh antigens).</p></li>
            <li><p>Require specialized matching for transfusions due to their rarity.</p></li>
                <li><p>Understanding blood groups is essential in medical practice for ensuring safe and effective blood transfusions and treatments.</p></li></ul>
                <center><b><u><h1>Blood disorders</h1></u></b></center>
                <img src="disorders.jpg" class="rightimage" width="400px" height="300px" border="5"></img> 
                <p>Disorders and diseases of the blood can impair the many functions that blood performs. Some common blood disorders are:</p>
                <ul><li><p>Anemia:This happens when low red blood cell or hemoglobin levelsTrusted Source mean the cells do not transport oxygen effectively, leading to fatigue, pale skin, and other symptoms.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Blood clotting:Clotting helps wounds and injuries heal, but blood clots that form inside a blood vessel can create a blockage, which can be life threatening. If clots become dislodged and move through the heart to the lungs, a pulmonary embolism can form.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Blood cancers:Cancers such as leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma occur when blood cells start to divide uncontrollably without dying off at the end of their life cycle.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Hemophilia:If a person has low levels of clotting factors in the blood, they can bruise or bleedTrusted Source very easily. They may bleed for too long after a minor injury or surgery, or during menstruation. It affects around 18,000 peopleTrusted Source in the U.S.</p></li>
                
                <li><p> Thalassemia: This is also a type of inherited anemia in which the body produces an unusual form of hemoglobin. It affected around 1,000Trusted Source people in the U.S. in 2008 and is most common in people from around the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. If symptoms suggest a person may have a blood disorder, they should seek medical advice. A doctor may refer them to a specialist in blood disorders, known as a hematologist.</p></li></ul>

                <h3>Advantages of Donating Blood</h3>
                <p>Donating blood can help people with many health conditions, such as those who:</p>
                <img src="donation.jpg" class="rightimage" width="400px" height="300px" border="5"></img> 
                    <ul><li><p>have internal or external bleeding due to an injury</p></li>
                        <li><p>have sickle cell disease or another illness that affects the blood</p></li>
                            <li><p>are undergoing surgery, such as cardiovascular or orthopedic surgery</p></li>
                                <li><p>have an inherited blood disorder</p></li>
                                    <li><p>need treatments involving plasma or other blood products</p></li>
                                        <li><p>are undergoing a transplant</p></li></ul>
                <p>The remaining 45% of blood mainly consists of red and white blood cells and platelets. Each of these has a vital role to play in keeping the blood functioning effectively.</p>
                
                
                <h3>Disdvantages of Donating Blood</h3>
                <p> Donating blood is safe, as long as the center follows the standard guidelines.The U.S. and many other countries have strict regulations to ensure safety. The FDA and American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) monitor blood banks for this purpose. Safety precautions they take include:</p>
                    <ul> <li><p>screening donors for existing health conditions</p></li>
                        <li><p> using new needles for each donation</p></li>
                <li><p>having professional staff on hand</p></li>
                    <li><p>providing monitoring and refreshments to ensure a safe recovery</p></li></ul>
